# üß† Agentic AI Development Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my **Agentic AI Development Journey** repository!  
This project documents my week-by-week progress as I learn and implement key concepts in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Deployment**.  
The course is guided by **Krish Naik**, and includes hands-on projects, visualizations, and deployment strategies.
